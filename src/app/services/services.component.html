    <h4>Lameness Evaluation</h4>
  </mz-modal-header>
  <mz-modal-content>
      Soundness is one of the most important if not
      the most important aspects of horse ownership. Ensuring that a horse is comfortable
      and pain free allows him to do his job to his fullest potential. If you notice
      that your horse is limping or not bearing weight evenly on all 4 legs, an
      evaluation by a veterinarian is warranted. During a lameness exam, the horse
      will be evaluated in motion on a straight line and in a circle in both
      directions. The horse will also be evaluated while standing. Once the affected
      leg is identified, in depth palpation and flexing will be performed. At that
      point, a systematic series of nerve blocks will be performed to isolate the
      area of problem. During the nerve blocking procedure, nerves on the leg are
      isolated and a small amount of lidocaine is placed over the nerve to numb the
      area that it controls. Nerve blocks are started at the lowest point on the leg
      move upwards as the exam progresses. Once the lameness is abolished with a
      nerve block, the lameness has been isolated. After the area is pinpointed,
      further diagnostics such as digital xray or ultrasound can be performed to
      elucidate the cause of the lameness.

    <h4>Dental Floating</h4>
  </mz-modal-header>
  <mz-modal-content>
      A horse’s teeth continue to erupt throughout their lives and are ground down as they masticate. Routine floating is necessary to keep the grinding surface of the molars flat to allow the horse to properly break down fibrous food. If a horse is unable to chew properly and break down food, the small intestine will not be able to absorb a sufficient amount of nutrients. The upper jaw of the horse is wider than the lower jaw. This unequal width creates a natural wear pattern in which sharp points form on the outside (cheek side) of the upper molars and inside (tongue side) of the lower molars. These uneven sharp points can cause painful ulceration of the sensitive oral mucosa. Hooks can also occur on the first and last molars due to poor oral conformation and can cause pain if left untreated. Wolf teeth are small teeth that erupt right in front of the first molars on the upper jaw. They can interfere with the bit and are usually extracted when the horse is young.
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
          <img src="assets/modal/dental1.jpg" alt="" class="lame3 dental1">
        </div>
      </div>
      Before your horse’s teeth are floated, a full physical exam will be done to assess general health and ensure that your horse is healthy enough for sedation. Then your horse will be very lightly sedated to ensure his comfort and safety during the procedure. A power float is used during the procedure to grind down any sharp enamel points or molar hooks that may be present. Using a power float as opposed to hand floats ensures precise treatment of each tooth without trauma to the surrounding sensitive oral tissue. It also takes less than half of the time compared to hand floating. This means less sedation, less stress, and less time that the mouth is open in the speculum.

      Regular oral exams and yearly dental floating is important to the overall health of the horse. Poor dental care can result in balling or dropping of food out of the mouth, weight loss, poor hair coat, and behavioral issues. <span class="bold">Oral examinations are included FOR FREE each time Dr. Friedlander vaccinates your horse.</span>

    <h4>Prepurchase Examinations</h4>
  </mz-modal-header>
  <mz-modal-content>
      It is very important to have a qualified veterinarian perform a comprehensive examination on a horse before it is purchased. A horse is not only expected to be a sound a healthy partner, it is also a considerable investment. It is said that the least expensive aspect to horse ownership is the purchase price. That being said, it is important to be as informed as possible before making a purchase. Dr. Friedlander offers 3 levels of Prepurchase examinations.

      <span class="bold">Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS)</span> 
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
      Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS) is common in foals and horses. Prevalence estimates have been reported to range from 25 to 50 percent in foals and 60 to 90 percent in adult horses, depending on age, performance, and evaluated populations. Although ulcers are similar in foals and horses, the syndromes frequently have different inciting causes and may produce different clinical signs. A diagnosis of these clinical syndromes relies on recognition of clinical signs and endoscopic examination of the stomach.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
      The horse stomach is divided into two distinct regions, the esophageal or non-glandular region and the glandular region. The esophageal region or squamous mucosa covers approximately one-third of the equine stomach, is void of glands, and is covered by stratified squamous epithelium similar to the esophagus. The glandular region covers the remaining two-thirds of the stomach and contains glands that secrete hydrochloric acid, pepsin, bicarbonate and mucus. A sharp demarcation or margo plicatus (cuticular ridge) separates the squamous mucosa from the glandular mucosa. Gastric ulcers in foals (less than 50 days of age) and adult horses are commonly located in the non-glandular region of the stomach adjacent to the margo plicatus along the greater curvature and lesser curvature. However, foals and adult horses with a concurrent medical disorder or being given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Bute or Banamine) may have gastric ulcers located in the glandular region of the stomach near the pylorus. Foals, and to a lesser extent in adult horses, may have duodenal ulcers, which may lead to gastric and esophageal ulcer, secondary to delayed gastric emptying.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
      The horse stomach continuously secretes variable amounts of hydrochloric acid throughout the day and night and secretion of acid occurs without the presence of feed material. The adult horses, the stomach secretes approximately 1.5 liters of gastric juice hourly and acid output ranges from 4 to 60 mmoles hydrochloric acid per hour. The pH of gastric contents ranges from 1.5 to 7.0, depending on region measured.

      </ul>
      <div>
        <span class="bold">Diagnosis and clinical signs:</span> 
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          The diagnosis of EGUS is based on the presence of clinical signs and confirmation with endoscopic examination. Clinical signs in foals include intermittent colic (after suckling or eating), frequent dorsal recumbency, intermittent nursing (interrupted nursing due to discomfort), diarrhea or history of diarrhea, poor appetite, bruxism (grinding of teeth), and ptyalism (excess salivation). The later two signs are often signs of an outflow obstruction, such as pyloric obstruction.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          Clinical signs in other horses include poor appetite or failure to consume a meal, dullness, attitude changes, poor appetite, decreased performance, reluctance to train, poor body condition, rough hair coat, weight loss, excessive recumbency, and low-grade colic. A presumptive diagnosis of EGUS can be made on these typical clinical signs and response to therapy. A definitive can only be made using a video or fibreoptic endoscope.

          Inhibiting gastric acid secretion is the mainstay of gastric ulcer treatment in horses. A number of treatment modalities have been used for treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in horses and foals. Currently, there is only one FDA approved treatment for gastric ulcers in horses, GastroGard (Omeprazole paste, Merial Limited, Atlanta, GA). However, many treatment modalities have been described in the literature. GastroGard (Omeprazole) is one of the most studied medication in horses. It is an “acid pump inhibitor” and inhibits gastric acid secretion regardless of the stimulus. GastroGard is a paste and is given to horses once daily for 28 days to treat EGUS. It is also labeled for prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcers at ½ dose. The medication contained in GastroGard is the same medication found in the “Purple Pill” Prilosec that is currently sold to humans for treatment of gastric ulcers. Ranitidine (Zantac) can also be used to aid in the protection and healing of gastric mucosa. This drug, however, must be given three times a day and is not as convenient as GastroGard. Aloe vera juice has also been studied as a holistic approach for the prevention of gastric ulcers but its efficacy has not been well documented.

    <h4>Shockwave Therapy</h4>
  </mz-modal-header>
  <mz-modal-content>
      <div>
        <span class="bold">
            Dr. Friedlander offers shock wave therapy in the field as a non-invasive treatment for a variety of soft-tissue injuries and musculoskeletal problems. Ask her if shockwave therapy is appropriate for your horse’s problem.
        </span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has become an emerging new technology for treating musculoskeletal problems, soft-tissue injuries and bone injuries in horses. ESWT is non-invasive, used to stimulate healing to return horses to a level of fully sound, useful activity without recurrence of disease.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          From outside the body (extracorporeal), the machine generates high-intensity shock or pressure waves, which pulse to a specific site within the injured tissue. Though its actual mode of action is still in dispute, it stimulates and accelerates the healing process, essentially combining an immediate analgesic effect with a reduction in inflammation, neovascularization in soft tissue and osteogenesis in bone. It can be used to treat various conditions, such as suspensory ligament desmitis, navicular disease, saucer fractures, bucked shins, bowed tendon, sesamoid fractures, stress fractures and vertebral spinal pain (kissing spine lesions).
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          The most common units today are portable and able for use with a standing horse in the barn or at the racetrack.
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/modal/shock1.jpg" alt="" class="lame3">
      </div>
      <div>
          The handheld wand of the unit attaches to an energy source. For the simplest shock wave procedure, the horse is lightly sedated; the area to be treated is shaved to provide for good contact; a contact gel is placed on the horse’s skin, and the hand unit is applied to the horse to deliver the shock wave pulses. The treatment takes minutes. The horse does not experience pain. Sedation is recommended so the horse remains still so the treatment is applied accurately, targeted to the specific treatment location, and if fractious, the veterinarian is protected.
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/modal/shock2.jpg" alt="" class="lame3">
      </div>
      <div>
          Electrical energy is used to initiate the pressure wave. The energy settings and the number of pulses are important. Too low energy or too few pulses might not create the desired therapeutic effect. Excessive energy or pulses may result in tendon damage. The pressure waves penetrate fluid and soft tissue, and their effects occur at sites at the bone/soft tissue interface.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          The mechanism by which shock waves stimulate healing is unknown. Theoretically, shock waves can increase cellular membrane permeability, cellular division, and stimulate cytokine production by bone marrow, neovascularization of soft tissue and osteogenesis in bone. Pressure waves might help physically break down or move a hematoma or fluid from the lesion to allow the fibroblasts to more rapidly fill the defect. At this time, the effect of ESWT on disease recurrence and future ligament strength has not been evaluated.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
          Today, the units have flexible therapy heads — similar to an ultrasound wand on a long chord — to be applied across the horse’s body to any anatomical site.

          Tendon and ligament injuries can be slow healing, and tend to scar making them less strong and more liable to tear again when the horse is put back into hard training.  This is partly due to the fact that there is very little blood supply in these types of tissues (as compared with muscle or skin, for instance).  A number of therapies have been tried for enhancing healing of these tissues, with varying degrees of success.

          One of the most promising treatments is stem cell therapy. Stem cells are primitive cells located in various parts of the body.  They are very versatile, being able to transform into bone, muscle, tendon or other kinds of tissue to replace the damaged cells in injured tissues.  There has been a lot of research in the past few years in stem cell therapy for human diseases, and now this technology is available in veterinary medicine.

      <span class="bold">What is IRAP?</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        IRAP stands for Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Protein and it utilizes progressive gene therapy to combat osteoarthritis in your horse. Osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative joint disease (DJD) and is one of the main causes of lameness in horses. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage surrounding the joints is destroyed, which produces pain and inflammation. Areas that are affected the most are knee, hock, fetlock and coffin joints. Usually, therapy involves intra-articular medications such as hyaluronic acid and/or steroids, rest, NSAIDS (bute or banamine), shockwave therapy, polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG) such as Adequan, intravenous hyaluronic acid (Legend), and oral supplements (for example GLC5500) that contain glucosamine and/or chondrotin sulfate.

        Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a type of cytokine and is secreted by many types of cells. A cytokine is a chemical secreted by the cells of the immune system to attack infections and apoptotic (damaged or dying) cells. IL-1 is an important part of the inflammatory response but in the case of your horseÃ¯Â¿Â½s joints, sometimes can be detrimental. The joint fluid carries a protein called interleukin-1, which plays an important role in inflammation and accelerates the deterioration of tissues like joint cartilage. Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Protein (IRAP) blocks IL-1 from binding to tissues and inhibits the damaging consequences of IL-1.

        The procedure begins with drawing blood from the horse that will be treated with IRAP into a syringe. The syringe is specially prepared with glass beads that stimulate production of the antagonist protein and an anticoagulant. The blood is harvested, incubated and centrifuged to separate the plasma (abundant with IRAP) from the blood. Typically, IRAP treatments are once a week for three weeks
        and usually, after that time, the horse can return to normal work

      <span class="bold">Why is IRAP used?</span> 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        IRAP is a product of the horse’s own body. IRAP is used in a similar application to intra-articular HA and corticosteriods. While corticosteriods are antiinflammatory, they damage cartilage cells over time and repeated intra-articular use. Corticosteriods have also been linked to laminitis.
